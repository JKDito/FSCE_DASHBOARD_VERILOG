# FSCE_DASHBOARD_VERILOG
dashboard display in verilog
/dev.rar has the project for EP4CE10 and a TFT display pad with a connector under the RGB16 restricts.
inside we also have the background for the display, lfa.mpg and the .mif file converted from it: lfa.mif;
I used the script my.sh file inside folder jic_generate to convert sof and elf into hex data;
